##### Description
###### This project involved analyzing a dataset on gun violence incidents to understand key factors influencing involvement. I performed data cleaning, exploratory visual analysis, and defined critical questions to formulate hypotheses. Advanced analyses included geospatial analysis, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and time series analysis. Finally, I created visualizations and a dashboard report in Tableau to summarize the key insights.

##### Topics Covered
###### Python, geospatial analysis, supervised machine learning, linear regression, unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering, time series analysis

##### Tools Used
###### Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Python, Tableau, Excel
